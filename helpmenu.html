    In this game, your character is a dog, trying to avoid bath time, your objective is to run <br>
    as long as you can, and avoid the dog kennel traps. To play this game you only need <br>
    space bar, to make the dog jump. By each 25meters you run, you'll earn a coin, that you <br>
    can later use to buy distance boosts, that make you start ahead of the regular distance! <br>
    You can control the music volume on the settings. <br>
    You now know everything you need to play this game! Good luck, and most important, have fun! </p>
